# tagtics - a file organizer

This project is designed to help you organize your files using tags. The goal is an austere alternative to TagSpaces and all its bloat or like Google Tag Manager without throwing away your well organized directory hierarchy.  

# Features (or lack of :))
- Retrieves all files from a specified directory (including subdirectories)
- Filters by specified tags
